# Presentation

Ladies and Gentlemen,

I appreciate the opportunity to address you today and share insights into the journey that led me to embark on this project. From the outset, the primary objective was clear: to create an innovative platform designed to address health concerns comprehensively. However, circumstances took an unexpected turn, as my team departed from the project on the very first day.

Undeterred by the challenges, I assumed sole responsibility for the project, transforming its scope from general medicine to an exclusive focus on skincare and hair care. The envisioned platform was intended to incorporate artificial intelligence, wherein users could articulate their health issues, enabling the system to generate personalized medical prescriptions via email. Simultaneously, the platform would guide users to esteemed dermatologists in Timisoara through embedded links.

While the current state of the site is nearly complete, regrettably, the implementation of the envisioned AI component encountered obstacles. Presently, a beta version resides within PyCharm, which, although functional for a segment of the site, lacks the training necessary to fulfill its intended purpose. It presently only displays pre-programmed responses based on patient selections.

Navigating this intricate path alone has presented challenges, and time constraints have prevented the realization of the full project potential. Despite these hurdles, I trust that the core idea resonates with you, embodying a commitment to enhancing healthcare accessibility and personalized guidance.

Thank you!
